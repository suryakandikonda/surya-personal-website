                <p>Hi.. I am Surya Kandikonda. I've been coding from past 3 years. I started with Python and developed a GUI based multiplayer game. That gave me the motivation to build things. I've taught myself about Web Designing and Server-side languages. I belive that <i>The things I build will be used by the real world users and their feedback is the most useful resource we get back, that helps us to do more great things.</i>I write about my work in my <a href="http://anocoder.blogspot.com/" tearget="_blank">Blog</a>. </p>
                <p>I am also active participant in Coding Events (Online/Offline). And I hold the responsibility as Joint Secretary for the College Association.</p>
                <p>This webpage is completely designed by me :). It is an example of Single-page Application (SPA).</p>
